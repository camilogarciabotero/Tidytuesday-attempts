This repositorie contains my attempts to visualize and understand datasets released on the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project. It is noteworthy that this repo will contain the `.Rmd` and `.html` versions that will be hosted on my [web page](https://camilogarciabotero.github.io)
